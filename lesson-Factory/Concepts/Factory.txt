Purpose:
To have different implementation for one interface
The Factory pattern is particularly useful when you have multiple implementations of an interface and need
to create instances of those implementations based on some condition or input.

When to Use the Factory Pattern:

1) Multiple Implementations:
    You have several classes that implement the same interface, and the specific implementation to be used is determined at runtime.
    
2) Complex Object Creation:
    The process of creating an object is complex or requires multiple steps, and you want to encapsulate this logic
    in a separate class (the factory).
    
3) Centralized Object Creation:
    You want to centralize the creation logic in one place, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.

Summary:
In summary, the Factory pattern is a powerful tool when dealing with multiple implementations of an interface,
allowing for clean and flexible object creation.

Understanding Dependency Injection ðŸ§ 
At its core, Dependency Injection is about removing the hard-coded dependencies and instead injecting them at runtime, allowing our application to be more flexible and easier to maintain. .NET Core has built-in support for DI, making it a first-class citizen in the framework.

Basic Concepts:
Service Container (or DI Container): A catalog of services and their corresponding implementations. Itâ€™s responsible for creating instances of types and managing their lifetimes.
Lifetime Management: Services can have different lifetimes:
Transient: A new instance is created every time a service is requested.
Scoped: A single instance is created per request.
Singleton: A single instance is created and shared throughout the applicationâ€™s lifetime.

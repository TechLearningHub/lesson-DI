Definition: A service registered with a transient lifetime is created each time it is requested.
This means that a new instance of the service is created every time it is injected into a consumer.

Example:
services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();

Behavior: Whenever you inject a service with a transient lifetime, a new instance of that service will be created.

public class MyController
{
    private readonly IMyService _myService1;
    private readonly IMyService _myService2;

    public MyController(IMyService myService1, IMyService myService2)
    {
        _myService1 = myService1;
        _myService2 = myService2;
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        // _myService1 and _myService2 are different instances
        _myService1.DoWork();
        _myService2.DoWork();
    }
}

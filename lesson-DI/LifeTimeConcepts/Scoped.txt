Definition: A service registered with a scoped lifetime is created once per request.
This means that within a single web request, all instances of a service are shared, but across different requests, 
new instances are created.

Example:
services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();

Behavior:
Within a single request, all instances of a scoped service are the same.

public class MyController
{
    private readonly IMyService _myService;

    public MyController(IMyService myService)
    {
        _myService = myService;
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        // _myService is the same instance throughout the request
        _myService.DoWork();
    }
}
